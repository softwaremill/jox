/**
 * Channel is a thread-safe data structure which exposes three basic operations:
 * <p>
 * - {@link Channel#send(Object)}-ing a value to the channel. Values can't be {@code null}.
 * - {@link Channel#receive()}-ing a value from the channel
 * - closing the channel using {@link Channel#done()} or {@link Channel#error(Throwable)}
 * <p>
 * There are three channel flavors:
 * <p>
 * - rendezvous channels, where senders and receivers must meet to exchange values
 * - buffered channels, where a given number of sent values might be buffered, before subsequent `send`s block
 * - unlimited channels, where an unlimited number of values might be buffered, hence `send` never blocks
 * <p>
 * The no-argument {@link Channel} constructor creates a rendezvous channel, while a buffered channel can be created
 * by providing a positive integer to the constructor. A rendezvous channel behaves like a buffered channel with
 * buffer size 0. An unlimited channel can be created using {@link Channel#newUnlimitedChannel()}.
 * <p>
 * In a rendezvous channel, senders and receivers block, until a matching party arrives (unless one is already waiting).
 * Similarly, buffered channels block if the buffer is full (in case of senders), or in case of receivers, if the
 * buffer is empty and there are no waiting senders.
 * <p>
 * All blocking operations behave properly upon interruption.
 * <p>
 * Channels might be closed, either because no more values will be produced by the source (using
 * {@link Channel#done()}), or because there was an error while producing or processing the received values (using
 * {@link Channel#error(Throwable)}).
 * <p>
 * After closing, no more values can be sent to the channel. If the channel is "done", any pending sends will be
 * completed normally. If the channel is in an "error" state, pending sends will be interrupted and will return with
 * the reason for the closure.
 * <p>
 * In case the channel is closed, one of the {@link ChannelClosedException}s is thrown. Alternatively, you can call
 * the less type-safe, but more exception-safe {@link Channel#sendSafe(Object)} and {@link Channel#receiveSafe()}
 * methods, which do not throw in case the channel is closed, but return one of the {@link ChannelClosed} values.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the values processed by the channel.

public final class Channel<T> implements Source<T>, Sink<T> {
    /*
    Inspired by the "Fast and Scalable Channels in Kotlin Coroutines" paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04986), and
    the Kotlin implementation (https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/kotlinx-coroutines-core/common/src/channels/BufferedChannel.kt).

    Notable differences from the Kotlin implementation:
    * we block (virtual) threads, instead of suspend functions
    * in Kotlin's channels, the buffer stores both the values (in even indexes), and the state for each cell (in odd
      indexes). This would be also possible here, but in two-thread rendezvous tests, this is slightly slower than the
      approach below: we transmit the values inside objects representing state. This does incur an additional
      allocation in case of the `Buffered` state (when there's a waiting receiver - we can't simply use a constant).
      However, we add a field to `Continuation` (which is a channel-specific class, unlike in Kotlin), to avoid the
      allocation when the sender suspends.
    * as we don't directly store values in the buffer, we don't need to clear them on interrupt etc. This is done
      automatically when the cell's state is set to something else than a Continuation/Buffered.
    * instead of the `completedExpandBuffersAndPauseFlag` counter, we maintain a counter of cells which haven't been
      interrupted & processed by `expandBuffer` in each segment. The segment becomes logically removed, only once all
      cells have been interrupted, processed & there are no pointers. The segment is notified that a cell is interrupted
      directly from `Continuation`, and that a cell is processed after `expandBuffer` completes.
    * the close procedure is a bit different - the Kotlin version does this "cooperatively", that is multiple threads
      that observe that the channel is closing participate in appropriate state mutations. This doesn't seem to be
      necessary in this implementation. Instead, `close()` sets the closed flag and closes the segment chain - which
      constraints the number of cells to close. `send()` observes the closed status right away, `receive()` observes
      it via the closed segment chain, or via closed cells. Same as in Kotlin, the cells are closed in reverse order.
      All eligible cells are attempted to be closed, so it's guaranteed that each operation will observe the closing
      appropriately.

    Other notes:
    * we need the previous pointers in segments to physically remove segments full of cells in the interrupted state.
      Segments before such an interrupted segments might still hold awaiting continuations. When physically removing a
      segment, we need to update the `next` pointer of the `previous` ("alive") segment. That way the memory usage is
      bounded by the number of awaiting threads.
    * after a `send`, if we know that R > s, or after a `receive`, when we know that S > r, we can set the `previous`
      pointer in the segment to `null`, so that the previous segments can be GCd. Even if there are still ongoing
      operations on these (previous) segments, and we'll end up wanting to remove such a segment, subsequent channel
      operations won't use them, so the relinking won't be useful.
