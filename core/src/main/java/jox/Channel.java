public class Channel<T> {
    /*
    Inspired by the "Fast and Scalable Channels in Kotlin Coroutines" paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04986), and
    the Kotlin implementation (https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/kotlinx-coroutines-core/common/src/channels/BufferedChannel.kt).

    Notable differences from the Kotlin implementation:
    * we block (virtual) threads, instead of suspend functions
    * in Kotlin's channels, the buffer stores both the elements (in even indexes), and the state for each cell (in odd
      indexes). This would be also possible here, but in two-thread rendezvous tests, this is slightly slower than the
      approach below: we transmit the elements inside objects representing state. This does incur an additional
      allocation in case of the `Buffered` state (when there's a waiting receiver - we can't simply use a constant).
      However, we add a field to `Continuation` (which is a channel-specific class, unlike in Kotlin), to avoid the
      allocation when the sender suspends.
    * as we don't directly store elements in the buffer, we don't need to clear them on interrupt etc. This is done
      automatically when the cell's state is set to something else than a Continuation/Buffered.
    * instead of the `completedExpandBuffersAndPauseFlag` counter, we maintain a counter of cells which haven't been
      processed by `expandBuffer` in each segment. The segment becomes logically removed, only once all cells have
      been interrupted, processed & there are no counters. The segment is notified that a cell is processed after
      `expandBuffer` completes.

    Other notes:
    * we need the previous pointers in segments to physically remove segments full of cells in the interrupted state.
      Segments before such an interrupted segments might still hold awaiting continuations. When physically removing a
      segment, we need to update the `next` pointer of the `previous` ("alive") segment. That way the memory usage is
      bounded by the number of awaiting threads.
    * after a `send`, if we know that R > s, or after a `receive`, when we know that S > r, we can set the `previous`
      pointer in the segment to `null`, so that the previous segments can be GCd. Even if there are still ongoing
      operations on these (previous) segments, and we'll end up wanting to remove such a segment, subsequent channel
      operations won't use them, so the relinking won't be useful.
