# Jox

[Virtual-thread](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/core/virtual-threads.html) based safe concurrency & streaming
for Java. Open-source, Apache2 licensed.

Jox contains three main modules:

* Fast & scalable, completable [channels](channels.md), with Go-like `select`s (Java 21+)
* Programmer-friendly [structured concurrency](structured.md) (Java 25 only)
* Finite & infinite streaming using [flows](flows.md), with reactive streams compatibility, (blocking) I/O integration
  and a high-level, "functional" API (Java 25 only)

Source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/softwaremill/jox).

## A tour of Jox

Selectable [channels](channels.md):

```
var ch1 = Channel.<Integer>newBufferedDefaultChannel();
var ch2 = Channel.<Integer>newBufferedDefaultChannel();
var ch3 = Channel.<Integer>newBufferedDefaultChannel();

// send a value to two channels
ch2.send(29);
ch3.send(32);

var received = select(ch1.receiveClause(), ch2.receiveClause(), ch3.receiveClause());
```

A push-based, backpressured [flow](flows.md) with time-based & parallel processing:

```
var nats =
  Flows.unfold(0, i -> Optional.of(Map.entry(i+1, i+1)));
 
Flows.range(1, 100, 1)
  .throttle(1, Duration.ofSeconds(1))
  .mapPar(4, i -> {
    Thread.sleep(5000);
    var j = i*3;
    return j+1;
  })
  .filter(i -> i % 2 == 0)
  .zip(nats)
  .runForeach(IO::println);
```

[Sructured concurrency](structured.md) scope:

```
var result = supervised(scope -> {
    var f1 = scope.fork(() -> {
        Thread.sleep(500);
        return 5;
    });
    var f2 = scope.fork(() -> {
        Thread.sleep(1000);
        return 6;
    });
    return f1.join() + f2.join();
});
IO.println("result = " + result);
```
